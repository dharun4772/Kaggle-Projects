Welcome to the 2024 Kaggle Playground Series! Happy New Year! This is the 1st episode of Season 4. We plan to continue in the spirit of previous playgrounds, providing interesting an approachable datasets for our community to practice their machine learning skills, and anticipate a competition each month.

Your Goal: For this Episode of the Series, your task is to predict whether a customer continues with their account or closes it (e.g., churns). Good luck!
Submissions are evaluated on area under the ROC curve between the predicted probability and the observed target.

The dataset for this competition (both train and test) was generated from a deep learning model trained on the Bank Customer Churn Prediction dataset.
Feature distributions are close to, but not exactly the same, as the original. 
Feel free to use the original dataset as part of this competition, both to explore differences as well as to see whether incorporating the original in training improves model performance.
